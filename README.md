# Automatic_calculation_of_the_time_shift
Automatic calculation of the time shift between 2 acoustic recorded non-synchronized

The purpose of this R script is to be able to define the time shift between 2 acoustic recorders non-synchronized (see https://github.com/FabienClaireau/Pairing_microphones)

Then, you can use : https://github.com/FabienClaireau/Find_bat_road_crossings
